# Unity-Shaders

## Description
A collection of shaders I've written & worked on over the last year. 

**NOTE:** *Some of these shaders were converted & edited from GLSL found on [Shadertoy](https://www.shadertoy.com/) into Unity's Shaderlab language (HLSL wrapper). All conversions were done manually by me, **NOT** auto-converted.*
